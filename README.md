## Overview

This repo is meant to demonstrate the auto-instrumentation of a Nestjs application with OpenTelemetry. Once the application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry, it is sent to SigNoz for monitoring and visualization.

## Steps to instrument Nestjs app with OpenTelemetry

### Setting up SigNoz

You need a backend to which you can send the collected data for monitoring and visualization. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an OpenTelemetry-native APM that is well-suited for visualizing OpenTelemetry data.

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. [Sign up](https://signoz.io/teams/) here for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

### Instrument app with OpenTelemetry

All the required OpenTelemetry packages are in `package.json` file. We have also configured the `tracer.ts` file with the endpoint for SigNoz cloud. You can check detailed instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/nestjs/).

### Run your application

Install the packages:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run your application:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>" nest start
```

You can get your ingestion details in SigNoz account under Settings --> Ingestion Settings.

Now the app will be running at http://localhost:3001  ðŸŽ‰

Make some requests to this application by calling the above URL multiple times. You can then check your NestJS application metrics in SigNoz dashboard.
